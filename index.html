    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> Hi there! My name is Tobie Lee, and I am a PhD student in the Quantitative & Computational Biosciences Program at Baylor College of Medicine. My research interests lie in finding novel experimental and data-driven approaches to better understand tumor microenvironment and metastasis. Outside of research, I enjoy running (trying to qualify for Boston), reading novels and short stories, cooking, playing soccer, and checking out museums.</p>
    <p> Previously, I worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://scinamic.com">Scinamic</a> for a couple years, which sparked my interest in developing computational tools to support translational research. I also worked as an assay biologist at <a href="https://c4therapeutics.com">C4 Therapeutics</a> and in  Dr. Matthew Hall’s (Guanine) Biology Group at the <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov">National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</a>, where I was involved in several high-throughput screening projects and developing assays for target validation. I received my BA in Biology and Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://wustl.edu">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. My undergrad research experience in <a href="http://sibleylab.wustl.edu">the Sibley Lab</a> was where I first got into biomedical research.</p>
